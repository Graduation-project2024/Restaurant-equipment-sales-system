4. Redistribution.
   You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
   (1) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

5. Submission of Contributions.
   Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall be construed as limiting or restricting the Licensor's rights to use or distribute Contributions made by You outside the scope of this License.
